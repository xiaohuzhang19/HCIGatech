## Introduction

Social network live audio applications such as Clubhouse gained great popularity in 2021 during the pandemic. 
People quite enjoy having a live audio chat within a chat room. 
Recently, Twitter also followed this trend and developed a similar feature as part of the Twitter ecosystem. It is called Twitter Space  (Twitter 2021).   
In this project, I will focus on evaluating and redesigning Twitter Space. I will evaluate the interface of Twitter Space and make potential enhancements to improve the user experience.
