## Introduction

This is the final project report for the OMSCS Program Human Computer Interaction class took in Fall 2022. I performed an analysis related to the Twitter Space function. The final grade for this project is 100/100. The high-level executive summary can be found below.

#### Executive Summary

Social network live audio applications such as Clubhouse gained great popularity in 2021 during the pandemic. 
People quite enjoy having a live audio chat within a chat room. 
Recently, Twitter also followed this trend and developed a similar feature as part of the Twitter ecosystem. It is called Twitter Space  (Twitter 2021).   
In this project, I will focus on evaluating and redesigning Twitter Space. I will evaluate the interface of Twitter Space and make potential enhancements to improve the user experience.

#### The detailed report will be provided upon request.
